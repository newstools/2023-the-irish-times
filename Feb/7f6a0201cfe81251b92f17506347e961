Sir, – While the Government is again considering cost-of-living top-ups, yet again there is no mention of measures for single person households. Welfare recipients and those on a fixed income are understandably to be considered, as inflation is particularly tough on people in those situations. Talk of another double child benefit payment is also on the cards thus assuaging families who have recently had significant reductions in childcare costs. Single person households are paying a proportionately higher amount of taxation on the same income. It costs the same to heat a one-person home as that of a family on less income. The same can be said of a mortgage or rent. They face greater challenges securing accommodation, given that there is less income. Food inflation also hits them particularly hard as the set up in supermarkets is generally geared towards families. When are we going to end this blatant discrimination? Single people vote too. – Yours, etc, NIAMH BYRNE, Fairview, Dublin.
