Disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein has been sentenced to 16 years in prison for rape and sexual assault at a Los Angeles court. The movie mogul was found guilty of rape and two other sexual misconduct charges involving a woman known as Jane Doe One, after a trial in December. The woman said the incident happened after Weinstein appeared uninvited at her hotel room during a Los Angeles film festival in 2013. Weinstein, the co-founder of Miramax Films, a US movie production and distribution house, will serve the sentence after completing his 23-year sentence for a sexual misconduct conviction in New York. Just before his sentencing, Weinstein begged judge Lisa Lench for “mercy”, telling her that he “didn’t deserve” to spend life behind bars, adding that the allegations against him had been a “set up”. “Your Honour… I maintain that I am innocent,” he told the packed out courtroom,” Weinstein said. “I never raped or sexually assaulted Jane Doe One. I don’t know that woman and she doesn’t know me. “This is a made-up story. With all due respect, Jane Doe One is an actress… Jane Doe One can turn on the tears. “Please don’t sentence me to life in prison, I don’t deserve it. I beg your mercy”. The former producer, who is 70 years old, was wheeled into court wearing a grey Los Angeles County jail uniform and remained seated as he addressed the court. During the two-month trial, which began in October last year, the court heard how Weinstein had used his influence to organise private meetings with women, where he attacked them. – Agencies
