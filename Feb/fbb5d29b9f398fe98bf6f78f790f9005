Sir, – Stephen Collins’s opinion piece is a stark reminder of the danger inflicted on democracy through social media (”Ambitious, young TDs are heading for the exit. Is political life becoming unbearable? Opinion & Analysis, February 17th). It must be wearying for those who stand for political office to be subjected to constant abuse and vilification. Good people are being lost as a result, with many potentially excellent candidates dissuaded from putting their heads above electoral parapet. Strict regulation and penalties are badly needed to protect those who are so often insulted and abused by “hurler on the ditch” types, whose only contribution to Irish life is to discourage and oppose. – Yours etc, NEVILLE SCARGILL, Bray, Co Wicklow.
