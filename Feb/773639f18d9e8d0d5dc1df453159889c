SuperValu began a Spanish and Portuguese wine sale yesterday, featuring up to 100 wines, according to the supermarket chain’s wine buyer Kevin O’Callaghan. “Spain has been doing well for us over the last five years. Last year it accounted for 15 per cent of total wine sales.” The majority of that was red wine, at 72 per cent, with 22 per cent white. Sparkling wines were up 2 percentage points, to 7 per cent of sales, suggesting consumers are beginning to realise the value offered by cava and other Spanish sparkling wine. “The younger generation is drinking better than their parents did. Minimum pricing has very little effect, other than consumers trading up – something we have always argued for,” he says. The sale runs until March 1st. Rich tropical fruits cut through with a strong zesty citrus acidity. This would be great with prawns, scallops, goat’s cheese and green Thai curries. Very good value. A rich and powerful blend of the Garnacha and Cariñena grape varieties (and confusingly from the region of Cariñena), this has rounded smooth dark fruits and a firm spicy finish. Try it with venison or roast red meats. Ripe smoky cassis and blackcurrants, with vanilla and nutmeg. Elegant yet powerful. You could enjoy this with grilled red meats (lamb would be perfect), firm cheeses or tomato and bean stews. Bright dark fruits, a savoury liquorice edge, fine-grained tannins and a lip-smacking minerality. Try it with roast vegetables, pepperonata, game, and rich beef stews.
