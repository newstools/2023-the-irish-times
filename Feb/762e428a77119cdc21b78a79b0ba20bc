Jack Kennedy has been named as the new editor of the Irish Farmers Journal. Mr Kennedy takes up the position with immediate effect after parent group The Agricultural Trust unanimously ratified his appointment, the newspaper said in a statement. His predecessor Justin McCarthy announced in October he would step down after a decade in the role. Mr Kennedy has been with the Farmers Journal for close to 20 years, serving as dairy editor and most recently as deputy editor, the newspaper added.
