Sir, – On reading Margaret Butler’s letter (February 17th), I also find myself worn down by the shouting matches that ensue on current affairs radio programmes, and also by that incessant need of the radio host or interviewer to get an answer. How often have we heard on our morning commute: “But Minister, please answer the question?” But there is a solution – in the mornings anyway – just switch the dial to RTÉ Lyric FM’s Marty in the Morning. For three hours there is peace and calm, and you can feel the blood pressure lower – there’s a lot to be said for it! – Yours, etc PAUL CASHMAN, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14.
