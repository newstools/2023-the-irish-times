Sir, – David Carroll ( Letters, February 15th) lauds Bertie Ahern’s leadership in presiding over unprecedented economic growth accompanied by significant tax cuts, rises in social protection payments and expansion of public services. Such a combination of measures couldn’t happen without alternative access to vast funding, particularly in the context Mr Ahern’s tax cuts. This begs the question where the money for the “unprecedented economic growth” engineered by Mr Ahern came from? The clue is in the €22 billion debt owed by the State after three election cycles with Mr Ahern at the helm, despite having inherited a balanced budget when he achieved power. Another clue is the arrival of the troika and the IMF bailout. David Carroll is correct in saying balance is needed when assessing Mr Ahern’s legacy, and his key role in bringing about the 1998 Belfast Agreement is undeniable. He is undoubtedly correct in saying Mr Ahern is astute. However, your letter writer should leave it at that. It’s hardly an accident that Mr Ahern’s economic “astuteness” brought three election victories for him and Fianna Fáil. Vested interests, including trade unions, were appeased in this pursuit. We are still paying the price for Mr Ahern’s economic mismanagement during his tenure in office. – Yours, etc, PJ McDERMOTT, Westport, Co Mayo.
