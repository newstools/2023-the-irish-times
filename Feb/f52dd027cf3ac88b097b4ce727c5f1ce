Sir, – As a mother, as a teacher, as a former pupil of single-sex schools, it was with huge disappointment that I read “Single-sex schooling is a peculiarly Irish mash-up of Catholicism and post-colonialism” (Jennifer O’Connell, Opinion & Analysis, February 25th), which is clearly coloured by antiquated notions of what school life is like in modern Ireland. Those of us who teach in single-sex schools are not dinosaurs, those of us who choose to send our children to single-sex schools are not foolish or unintelligent, and those who attend single-sex schools are not isolated from 50 per cent of society, and do not end up socially challenged or psychologically damaged. There are few families who cannot choose to send their children to co-ed or non-denominational schools if they so choose. It is upsetting to read how depriving families of options is something to be celebrated. – Yours, etc, SARAH NESTOR, Dundalk, Co Louth.
