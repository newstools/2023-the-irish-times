Sir, – I do hope that political commentators and journalists will avoid referring to the proposed agreement between the EU and the British government regarding the Northern Ireland Protocol as the “Treaty of Windsor”. Some of us still remember the first Treaty of Windsor agreed between Ruaidhrí Ua Conchobair (Rory O’Connor), last High King of Ireland and Henry II of England in October 1175. Ruaidhrí submitted to Henry, conditional on Henry agreement to the Irish king’s overlordship over Ireland, apart from the ancient province of Leinster and the cities of Dublin, Waterford and Wexford. The treaty was soon broken because of Henry’s inability to control the territorial ambitions of the Anglo-Norman barons and its terms were effectively repudiated in 1177 when Henry appointed his son, John, as Lord of Ireland. – Is mise, RAGHNALL Ó FLOINN, Phibsborough, Dublin 7.
