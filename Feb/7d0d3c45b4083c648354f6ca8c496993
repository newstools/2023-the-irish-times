Sir, – Your editorial (February 9th) urging caution in the management of the national finances is both timely and welcome. Like any responsible household, the Government has to have its reserve fund for unforeseen expenses. Intergenerational justice also asks that the prosperity of the next generation is not sacrificed to current demands. Tax relief on mortgage payments was necessary when interest rates were in double-digit figures, and Government would be unwise to yield to voices calling for the reintroduction of such a measure. – Yours, etc, MARGARET LEE, Newport, Co Tipperary.
