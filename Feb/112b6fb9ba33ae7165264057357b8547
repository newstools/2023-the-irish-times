A 36-year-old woman who was due to stand trial for the attempted murder of a man she allegedly met on Tinder has admitted the lesser charge of intentionally trying to cause him serious harm. Inita Romanovska, with an address at Cahercalla, Kilrush Road, Ennis, Co Clare, was charged with attempting to murder Stephen O’Flaherty during an incident at an apartment complex at Henry Street, Limerick on March 11th 2020. Limerick District Court previously heard that Romanovska attacked Mr O’Flaherty with a knife, stabbing him in the chest and right and upper left shoulder. She allegedly wore a disguise during the attack to prevent herself being identified. She “repeatedly and vehemently denied” that a person captured on CCTV in the vicinity of the apartment complex was her. She and Mr O’Flaherty had been on a number of dates at the time but were not in a relationship, the court heard. In February 2021, Romanovska was told she would not stand trial at the Central Criminal Court for over two years due to the backlog of court cases that had arisen during the pandemic. When the case was listed for mention on Friday, her defence barrister Mr Michael Bowman SC told Mr Justice Paul McDermott that his client could be arraigned on count two of the indictment. Romanovska then pleaded guilty to a charge of intentionally attempting to cause serious harm to Mr O’Flaherty at Newtown House, Henry Street, Limerick on March 11th 2020. The defendant, who is originally from Latvia and remains on bail, was scheduled to stand trial at the Central Criminal Court on March 6th next for a two-week trial. Mr Bowman told the judge today that his client is a 36-year-old single mother with no previous convictions and asked the court to order and consider a pre-sentence report, which the judge agreed to do. Romanovska’s trial date has now been vacated. Mr Justice McDermott directed a victim impact report and remanded Romanovska on continuing bail until May 23rd, when she will be sentenced.
