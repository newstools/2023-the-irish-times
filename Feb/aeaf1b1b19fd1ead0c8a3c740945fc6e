Archbishop Luis Mariano Montemayor has been appointed as the new papal nuncio for Ireland. The appointment, confirmed by the Vatican on Saturday morning, was welcomed by the Primate of All Ireland, Archbishop Eamon Martin, who said he would look forward to meeting the new envoy for Pope Francis when he relocates to Ireland.

He has served roles within the Catholic Church’s diplomatic corps in in Ethiopia and Brazil before being appointed papal nuncio for Senegal, Guinea-Bissau e Capo Verde in 2008. He also served as the papal nuncio in the Democratic Republic of Congo. He speaks fluent Spanish, Italian, French, English, and Portuguese.
