Sir, – As one who has corresponded previously in support of the completion of the long-planned Dublin Area Rapid Transit project through the construction of the vital tunnel section through the city, I was very pleased to read Frank McDonald’s opinion piece in support of this missing link (“Dart + Tunnel is the missing link in Dublin’s transport plans”, Opinion & Analysis, February 16th). He mentions the 1975 plan drawn up for CIÉ which proposes an integrated Dart network, including the tunnel but also including a Dart link from the Sallins line to the then planned “new town” of Tallaght. This high-capacity transport proposal was subsequently usurped by the much lower-capacity and slower Luas line, representing another missed opportunity. Frank McDonald surmises that the preference for Metro North was due to it being “more alluring” to politicians, conjuring up visions of the Paris Metro, and also speculates that the fact that the Dart was an Irish Rail project, rather than an National Transport Authority and Transport Infrastructure Ireland project, was to its detriment. While these reasons may have some validity, I have always suspected that the real economic driver of Metro North had little to do with Dublin Airport or with integrated transport planning but was more related to the role that Metro North would have in “opening up” large areas of undeveloped lands between the airport and Swords. – Yours, etc, ADRIAN CONWAY, Kilcloon, Co Meath. Sir, – When I saw the graphic for the “Alternative Integrated Dublin Rail Network”, I thought for a moment that it was one of Martyn Turner’s cartoons, as it was in his usual position in the paper. I then realised that it was associated with the article beneath it. However, I now realise that it is nearly as funny as many of his previous offerings, given that it is similarly grounded in comedic fantasy. – Yours, etc, TOM HIGGINS, Shankill, Co Dublin.
