1. Whisk the cornflour with three tablespoons of water or wine. Set aside. 2. Grate the cheese. Bruise the garlic clove and add it to the pot with the white wine. Heat until it begins to simmer. 3. Whisk in the cheese gradually. Melt the cheese in, one handful at a time, while whisking constantly. 4. Stir in the cornflour paste. This will help to prevent it from splitting and will guarantee a smooth, thick sauce. 5. Season to taste, adding the pepper and nutmeg. Whisk gently if it starts to separate. Serve right away in the pot or transfer to a bowl, ideally keeping it warm at the table.
