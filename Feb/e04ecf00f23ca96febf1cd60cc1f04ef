Sir, – The next election of a president of Ireland is due to take place in 2025. The duties are largely ceremonial and therefore I think it is high time that the length of service in the post be reduced. I propose that the Constitution be amended to state that the length of tenure of all presidents, as from the next election, be a term of four years, with a maximum of eight years, if re-elected. Fourteen years is just too long a time to have the same person in “The Park”. – Yours, etc, CLAIRE KENNEDY, Galway.
