Sir, – I was sorry to read of the death of Graeme Guthrie (Una Mullally, “I learned recently a prolific Irish Times letter-writer had died – his correspondence was a tonic”, Opinion & Analysis, February 27th). Among his many contributions to the letters page, always worth reading, was one in August 2021 in which he lamented the decline of rugby union as a spectacle, mired in over-technical and often incomprehensible laws. Despite the entertaining nature of many of the more recent Six Nations games, his basic criticism of the laws still stands. May he rest in peace, and thanks to Una Mullally for a very human appreciation of a life through letters. – Yours, etc, BILL REDMOND, Edinburgh, Scotland.
