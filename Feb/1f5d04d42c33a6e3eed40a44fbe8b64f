US actor and model Raquel Welch has died at the age of 82. She rose to fame after starring in Fantastic Voyage and One Million Years BC in 1966, despite only having a small number of lines in the latter. Her performance in One Million Years BC garnered viewer attention after she donned a now-infamous deerskin bikini, going on to become regarded as a major sex symbol. Welch died after a brief illness early on Wednesday, her manager said.
