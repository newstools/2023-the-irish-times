Sir, – I wholeheartedly agree with the concerns of Edmond Cannon (Letters, February 16th) regarding the offloading of legislative planning and policy development to the citizens’ assembly. I do not accept that such important matters regarding the regulation and protection of citizens should be handed over to an unelected body. Given the random selection process, there is a good chance that members have little or no expertise, experience or wisdom to offer on the issues for consideration. We elect our politicians to legislate on our behalf. Let them get on with the job. – Yours, etc, DÁITHÍ Ó HAODHA, Bishopstown Ave, Cork.
