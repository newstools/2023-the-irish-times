FOR THE CHEESE CUSTARD 1. Put half of the cream and half of the milk into a pot. Add the garlic and cheese, and heat until warm. 2. In a bowl, add the remaining milk and cream with the egg and egg yolk, and pour the warm cream mix into it. Whisk until mixed together, and season with salt and pepper. 3. Pour the mixture into a non-stick dish, and place the dish inside a larger dish filled half way with water. Cook for 25 minutes at 185 degrees and then allow to cool. FOR THE GRILLED LEEKS 1. Split the leeks in half lengthways and wash under cold water to remove any grit. 2. Bring a pot of water to a simmer and add the leeks. Cook for eight minutes. Strain and cool. 3. Place the leeks on to a tray and rub in the olive oil, sugar, salt and thyme. Season with salt and pepper. Place the leeks under a hot grill for five minutes (until caramelised), and then set aside. FOR THE PANGRATTATO 1. Melt the butter in a pan and add the breadcrumbs, garlic and parsley. Cook until the breadcrumbs are golden brown. TO ASSEMBLE 1. Scoop the cheese custard on to a plate, add the leeks and pangrattato, and garnish with olive oil and seasoned mixed leaves.
