Sir, – Whenever I despair about the lack of common sense and indisputable logic in today’s world, I am rescued from my woes by the stunning, pinpoint accuracy and substance of Michael McDowell’s writing. In his opinion piece (“Private landlords in Ireland have little choice but to exit the market”, February 15th), he describes the Government as “paddling in its housing canoe towards a foaming electoral Niagara”. It is a tragedy that the Government parties have been led by the nose into alienating those who are their natural supporters in an attempt to sate the populist philosophies of those who will never be theirs. It is time to grow up and establish a new and healthy relationship between landlords and tenants – one where tenants feel safe and secure while landlords are not taxed and legislated into oblivion. If action is not taken to include landlords as part of the housing solution, the slogan during the next election will undoubtedly be “It’s the housing crisis, stupid!” – Yours, etc, NEVILLE SCARGILL, Bray, Co Wicklow.
