A man has been charged with theft after a trailer-load of 200,000 Creme Eggs were stolen from an industrial unit. Joby Pool was arrested in connection with the incident on February 11th, which involved an estimated £40,000 (€45,350)(€45,280) worth of confectionery, West Mercia Police said. In a series of tweets, the force said the “eggs-travagant theft” unfolded at Stafford Park in Telford, Shropshire. “A number of other chocolate varieties were also stolen,” police said. In a statement, the force added: “Shortly after the theft a vehicle, presumably purporting to be the Easter bunny, was stopped northbound on the M42 and a man was arrested on suspicion of theft.” Mr Pool (32), of no fixed address, is facing two charges of theft and another of criminal damage, after a chain lock was also allegedly broken. Shropshire Fire and Rescue Service’s Market Drayton station replied to news the haul had been recovered, telling police “eggcellent work by all involved”. — PA
