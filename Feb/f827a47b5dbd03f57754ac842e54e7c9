Sir, – That 36 Ministers and Ministers of State are travelling to 74 cities in 44 countries to mark St Patrick’s Day is a triumph of logistics (News, February 14th). But who’s at home minding the farm? – Yours, etc, Dr JOHN DOHERTY, Gaoth Dobhair, Co Dhún na nGall. Sir, – It would appear that in celebrating St Patrick’s Day, the Green members of Cabinet have decided that the grass must be indeed be greener the further you go but appear to have forgotten the carbon footprint that their trips will leave. The Minister for Transport is off to Singapore and China, The Minister for Children is off to India. The Minister for Tourism is off to Los Angeles. The Minister for State with responsibility for land use is off to Kenya and Tanzania. The Minister for State with special responsibility for the circular economy is off to Belgium and the Netherlands. While it is appreciated that much work is part and parcel of these trips, I would have thought that the Green Ministers would have led by example, by putting into practice what they preach, and opted either to stay at home or to take some of the shorter trips. – Yours, etc, ANTAINE O’DUIBHIR, Ranelagh, Dublin 6. Sir, – With 36 Ministers and Ministers of State leaving the country for St Patrick’s Day, it is to be sincerely hoped that they are not taking their departmental secretaries with them, otherwise we will have no one left to run the show in the event of a national emergency. – Yours, etc, LOUIS O’FLAHERTY, Santry, Dublin 9. Sir, – Following the announcement that Eamon Ryan will travel to China, further than any other politician this St Patrick’s Day, Katie Melua should change the lyrics of her worldwide hit to “There are nine million and one bicycles in Beijing”. – Yours, etc, EAMON FARRELL, Dublin 4.
