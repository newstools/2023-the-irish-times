Sir, – The Temporary Business Energy Support Scheme scheme will still not be taken up by small firms unless the application process is simplified. As a small business owner, I have attempted, without success, to fight my way through the 122-page guideline booklet and the complicated online application process which appears to have been designed to discourage businesses such as ours from availing of this much-needed support. Perhaps those behind it should employ the well-known Kiss principal – Keep It Simple, Stupid. – Yours, etc, ALEX TAYLOR, Ballinteer, Dublin 16.
