Like everything else in life, pancakes seem to have gotten more complicated. In our house they’re simple. If the question is: “What’s for lunch” the routine answer is pancakes. There is a visual allure to a stack of thick American pancakes, but they’re too fluffy for me. I must say, I do like my pancakes silky and elastic. Air is the enemy of this skin-thin French-style crepe. The food bible Larousse recommends letting your batter stand so it will breathe out any air beaten into it before you dream of pouring it on to the pan. A good pan makes good pancakes. A dollop of sunflower oil heated and then wiped with a piece of kitchen roll leaves just a glossy sheen, to avoid oily-pancake syndrome. Keep the kitchen roll to hand to regrease the pan between pancakes. Flipping is best tried after you’ve first worked the pancake free with a fish slice. Ensure both sides are cooked first unless you want to pebble-dash yourself with batter. A traditional savoury filling is a bechamel sauce with ham or mushrooms, but that can feel too glutenous for some. Try mushrooms and finely chopped shallots fried in butter, then mixed with a dollop of creme fraiche at the end and a good grating of Gruyere and flat-leaf parsley. Sweet pancakes need lemon juice (from a lemon, not a bottle) and caster sugar or maple syrup. Toasted almonds, hazelnuts or walnuts also work with a drizzle of caramel sauce, to give you the melted-Snickers-bar effect without the calorie load. This quantity makes up to three medium pancakes (a good suggested serving per person) Read: What is in a pancake mix?
