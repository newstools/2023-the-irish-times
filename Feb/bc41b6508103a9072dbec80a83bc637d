Southampton have ended their interest in making Jesse Marsch their new manager after talks broke down over the proposed length of contract. Marsch, who was sacked by Leeds last Monday, had positive conversations with Southampton officials this week and was expected to succeed Nathan Jones. However it is understood that, having agreed to take over verbally, negotiations with the American faltered because Southampton were only prepared to offer him a contract until the end of the season, with Marsch hoping for a longer-term deal. First-team coach Rubén Sellés will continue to take the team in training and for Saturday’s match at Chelsea, with the 39-year-old emerging as a potential alternative to Marsch. Southampton could consider hiring an experienced coach to work alongside the Spaniard, who is highly regarded at St Mary’s. Southampton’s board have had interest from a number of other candidates, including the former Everton manager Frank Lampard, and the DC United manager Wayne Rooney. Jones was sacked after 14 games, with a run of seven defeats in eight Premier League matches leading to his exit three months into a three-and-a-half-year contract. The Welshman lasted 94 days, the shortest managerial tenure in Southampton’s history. – Guardian
