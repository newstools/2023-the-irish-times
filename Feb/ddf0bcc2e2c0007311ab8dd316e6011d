Sir, – Like everyone in the Irish film community, I was shocked and saddened to hear about the untimely death of James Flynn (Donald Clarke, “James Flynn obituary: A producer who helped it seem natural for Hollywood to shoot in Ireland”, February 13th). The loss to Irish film culture is immense, not only because of James’s crucial involvement in the development of the film industry, but because he supported directors as well as producers. My film Nora wouldn’t have happened without him. Some producers go to ground when problems arise, but James confronted issues head on and resolved difficult situations with wisdom, humour and good sense. His commitment to the film was over and above the call of duty. His supportive, generous spirit will be greatly missed. – Yours, etc, PAT MURPHY, Dublin 8. Sir, – I see Donald Clarke’s fine piece on the death of the much-loved James Flynn, first business manager to Michael D Higgins’s re-established Film Board in 1993. He was the first person we appointed, before even Rod Stoneman, and we had some heady times in Galway, getting a whole new idea started. The entire Irish film community (and many all over the world) are saddened. His great virtue was his always helpful support for the beginner and the experienced. He went far beyond his executive role on films supported by the board. An always encouraging, clever, hugely knowledgeable, lovely man. Safe flight, James, over the rainbow. – Yours, etc, LELIA DOOLAN, Kilcolgan, Co Galway.
