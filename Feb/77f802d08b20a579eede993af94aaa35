FOR THE ALIGOT 1. Bake the potatoes in the oven for 30-45 minutes, until soft. Cut in half and pass the white flesh through a sieve to remove any lumps. Add to a pot with the garlic, cream, butter, cheese, salt and pepper, and mix until smooth. FOR THE TAPENADE 1. Blitz all ingredients in a food processor until smooth. If you donâ€™t have a food processor, hand chop finely and mix in a bowl. FOR THE PORK 2. Heat the oil in a pan and add the Iberico pork. Cook for 12 minutes, turning every 30 seconds (depending on the thickness, you may want to alter the cooking time). Add the butter and baste with a spoon. Transfer the pork to a wire rack to rest. 3. Add the greens, anchovies and garlic to the pan, and cook for four minutes. 4. Slice the pork and serve with the aligot, tapenade, greens and crispy onion.
