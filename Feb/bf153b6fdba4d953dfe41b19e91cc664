Sir, – Further to “Campaigning for access to contraceptives across the decades” (Life & Style, February 11th), 2023 not only marks the 30th anniversary of the full availability of condoms in the Republic but also the 50th anniversary of the judgment in the Mary McGee case. December 19th of this year marks the date on which this heroic young mother won her challenge to the State and the church over her right to reproductive control and, in doing so, saved the lives of women who, as in her own case, could have died from further pregnancies. Her victory liberated over half the population from repressive interference in their personal lives. I would expect the women of Ireland – and some of the men – to mark this occasion as the great humanitarian achievement it was. – Yours, etc, MÁIRÍN DE BURCA, Marino, Dublin 3.
