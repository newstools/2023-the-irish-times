Sir, – Kevin O’Sullivan highlights Ireland’s woeful wetland destruction record and the implications as wetlands are essential to address climate change and biodiversity loss (“Ireland worst in world for wetlands depletion over past three centuries, global study finds”, News, February . While it is important to state past loss, let us now focus on removal of obstacles to halting loss and achieving the necessary restoration. Take, for example, the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 requirement for the Office of Public Works to maintain wetland drainage carried out decades ago. A simple amendment of the Act would free the OPW from this perverse obligation. Drainage, erosion and flood defence schemes could just be assessed in light of today’s needs, where biodiversity, water quality and climate considerations are not subservient to an ancient law. Note also that the three wetland types mentioned in the article – peatlands, turloughs and saltmarshes – are among the most difficult to restore. Many others, like ponds, reed beds, small streams and ditches which should provide vital wildlife habitat and water storage can often be restored at affordable costs for private land owners and offer biodiversity and water quality rewards within months. Mind you, until farmers get acknowledged for quality wetlands, instead of being financially penalised, loss is almost inevitable. Once outside a Natura 2000 site, you can infill small ponds and marl holes without any permit. It could have the most endangered beetles in there, but no one will ever know. – Yours, etc, KARIN DUBSKY, Coastwatch, Dublin 2.
