Sir, – Frank McDonald’s piece (“DART + Tunnel is the missing link in Dublin’s transport plans”, Opinion & Analysis, February 16th) comes at a most opportune time with the draft all-island strategic rail review now available to decision makers. However, in highlighting the transformative benefit for Dublin of linking Heuston Station with Docklands station, Frank McDonald omits reference to an equally significant strategic advantage of that link: a direct connection between the Belfast and Cork mainlines. Provided that the underground section is constructed to mainline specifications (and there is little reason why it should not be so if it is to meet the requirements for operation of Dart trains) then a much-needed integrated national rail network can be simultaneously delivered. The north-east to south-west intercity services, as well as outer suburban and Dart services on the same corridor, would interconnect at Pearse station with similar train services on the north-west to south-east corridor, thereby providing a single city-centre rail interchange point. In order to deliver an effective interchange facility it will be necessary to ensure that the design of the underground section of Pearse station is of adequate platform capacity to facilitate through running of commuter services during the longer dwell times of intercity trains, and also to cater for cross-platform interchange between intercity and commuter services. The provision of a single city-centre rail centre in Dublin where passengers can easily interchange between train services on all routes into and out of Dublin would be of significant benefit to business, leisure, and commuter travellers alike. The inclusion of the short extension of the Dart network from Clongriffin to Dublin Airport can deliver the same rail inter-connectivity directly to airline travellers. Carefully considered and focussed investment in our national rail network can deliver transformative benefits for the traveller, the environment, and the economy as a whole. – Yours, etc, GERALD BEESLEY, CEng Saltmills, Co Wexford.
