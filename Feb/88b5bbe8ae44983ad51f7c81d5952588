Rangers 1 Celtic 2 It was appropriate that the two pieces of genuine quality in an instantly forgettable final were sufficient to win the League Cup for Celtic. Rangers had a pulse after Alfredo Morelos reduced a deficit which had sat at 2-0 but Kyogo Furuhashi’s earlier interventions proved key. Ange Postecoglou’s team have successfully defended their trophy and punctured the sense of optimism apparent at Ibrox since Michael Beale’s arrival. The more cohesive football here was played by those in hoops. Furuhashi rounded off a sweeping move also involving Reo Hatate, Aaron Mooy and Greg Taylor to afford Celtic an interval lead they just about deserved. Rangers had been obdurate but offered little in attack. Furuhashi and Jota had earlier been denied by the veteran Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor. Ryan Kent cracked a post as Rangers chased second-half salvation. Instead, Furuhashi struck again from close range. Callum McGregor fed Mooy, whose pass to Hatate preceded an inch-perfect cross. James Tavernier had cheaply conceded Rangers possession. Morelos converted a Tavernier free-kick which somehow evaded everyone else, with Rangers sensing they could breach Celtic’s resistance again. The closest they came to that involved an incident where both Antonio Colak and Borna Barisic failed to control the ball. Celtic should have added gloss to victory, Sead Haksabanovic screwing wide after racing clean through on goal. This wastefulness pretty much summed up a grim final; not that Celtic care. They remain Scotland’s dominant force. – Guardian More to follow
