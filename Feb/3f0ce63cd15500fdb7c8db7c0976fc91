Sir, – In response to the letter writer (February 15th) who raised the point of storing nuclear waste, yes, there has been no viable storage for nuclear waste, until now. Finland now has almost completed an underground storage vault that can safely store waste for over 100,000 years. Sweden has just approved another. Nuclear power is now a much safer alternative than only a few years ago and is much better than the guaranteed ill-effects of fossil fuels on health and climate change. When combined with optimised grid designs, along with wind and solar generation, it can lead to a brighter future for all. If we keep the status quo of fear placed by the fossil fuel industry and well-meaning environmentalists around nuclear power, it will end in guaranteed power outages and climate disaster for all. Ireland needs to bite the bullet and work towards being powered by our own small nuclear plants. – Yours, etc, MICHEÁL FALLON, Doughiska, Co Galway.
