Sir, – I am aware of a campaign by disability advocacy groups to extend the law regarding parking in disabled spaces to private car parks. This would be a most welcome development, although the key would be enforcement, which also applies to public spaces as there is a perception that when paid parking ends in the evening and the traffic wardens go home, the prohibition on parking in disabled spaces expires with it. I lost my right leg above the knee just over 10 years ago. I recommenced driving as a disabled driver almost five years ago and as such I am very conscious of the need to find a disabled parking space when I go out. These are scarce and are often abused. In private car parks when I complain I am frequently told by the proprietor that as the offender is a good customer, they are not prepared to upset them by asking them to move. However, parking is only one issue. There are two others: access to premises in the first place and accessible toilet facilities once inside. In this connection, restaurant critics please note if a premises does not have accessible toilets, it is not accessible. It is discriminatory that a proprietor has no obligation to make their premises accessible if they were in existence before the relevant legislation was passed, unless physical improvements are made. Every premises should have a fully serviced disabled toilet which should not double as anything else. Only disabled people should have access to these facilities, preferably via a key obtainable from the manager. All public utilities have the duty to ensure that all their customers are treated with the dignity that befits human beings, even if profits have to take the occasional hit. – Yours, etc, SEAN O’DONNELL, Ardee, Co Louth.
