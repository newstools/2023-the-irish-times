FOR THE CHERRIES 1. In a bowl, mix the cherries, vinegar, sugar and honey and stir altogether. Allow to sit for 30 minutes. FOR THE CUSTARD 1. Put the cream, milk and grated cardamom (grate it with a fine grater) into a pan and bring to a simmer. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk the yolks, cornflour, sugar and vanilla. Gradually pour the hot milk mixture on to the egg and sugar mixture, and whisk continuously. 3. Pour the mixture into a new pan and gently heat until thickened, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. FOR THE HONEYCOMB 1. Heat the sugar and golden syrup in a wide bottom pan. Using a sugar thermometer, bring the mixture to 150 degrees. Remove from the heat and whisk in the baking soda. Transfer to a tray lined with baking parchment and allow to cool before breaking it up. TO ASSEMBLE 1. Layer the cherries, custard and honeycomb into a glass. Top with whipped cream, cherries and chocolate.
