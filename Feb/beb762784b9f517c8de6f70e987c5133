1. Place the pasta into a pan of simmering boiled salted water. Simmer for eight to 10 minutes depending on your pasta shape. It’s nice when it’s still slightly al dente. 2. In a frying pan add the olive oil and sliced garlic. Fry gently on a low heat for two minutes, until fragrant. 3. Add the gochujang paste and tomato purée, fry for a few minutes before adding two ladles of pasta water. Reduce the heat to a simmer. Add the cream and Parmesan, stirring well so it forms a smooth creamy sauce. Add a little more pasta water if needed. 4. Drain the pasta and return it to the pan. Pour the sauce into the pan and stir well to coat the pasta. Scatter extra Parmesan on top and serve with some broccoli or spinach.
