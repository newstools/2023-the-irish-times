Sir, – My letter attempts to serve as a friendly reminder to the media in general that not everyone leaving or attempting to leave Ireland is young or an intern or a recent college graduate or just starting out. Many of us from previous generations have the same struggles trying to stay in Ireland especially in finding quality, affordable homes to rent. I find that journalists seem to think anyone 50 years of age or older in this country owns their own home and is financially sorted. As a single, middle-aged person, I have to live at my parents’ home here in Ireland often for long stretches at a time, even when working. It is simple arithmetic, in my experience: the net pay does not cover the housing costs and there are too few housing options in Ireland for single people. I have had several wonderful live-in relationships which are hugely helpful for splitting the bills. Should I resort now to a Victorian woman’s attempt at finding a husband or partner to share the purchase and expense of a home? Just how progressive is this nation after all? I have accepted the situation. I have accepted that I should always keep my passport up to date as I continue my work and home search here and in those foreign lands previously proven to appreciate my skills, maturity and experience and to provide me with affordable, safe shelter. – Yours, etc, VIVIENNE LYNCH, Tullamore, Co Offaly.
