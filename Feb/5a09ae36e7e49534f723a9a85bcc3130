Sir, – If Michael McDowell is thinking of another column bemoaning the tough time private landlords are having in the current climate (“Private landlords in Ireland have little choice but to exit the market”, Opinion & Analysis, February 15th), I would instead suggest passing him the world’s smallest violin. – Yours, etc, ALISON TREACY, Glenageary, Co Dublin. Sir, – I worked for 45 years and have a mixed self-employed and PAYE insurance record (PRSI). On reaching my 65th birthday, I applied for the old-age pension, which is payable once you satisfy the insurance record requirements. I was refused because I had more than €8,000 of rental income in the year of assessment and was classified as self-employed by the Revenue Commissioners. No such restriction would apply if I had a public or private income or pension. “Experts” express bewilderment as to why landlords are leaving the rental market but can you blame landlords, when such a discriminatory policy is in place? – Yours, etc, KEVIN G MOYNIHAN, Killarney, Co Kerry.
