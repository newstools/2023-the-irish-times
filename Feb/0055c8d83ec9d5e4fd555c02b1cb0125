Two wines from Lidl this week, both from the north west of Italy. Gavi is made from the cortese grape, grown almost exclusively in the Piemonte region. The vast majority of wines are unoaked and light in alcohol, perfect before dinner or with seafood. Barbera is one of the most widely planted grapes in Italy but mainly found in the north west. The wines are very versatile. With plenty of fruit, medium alcohol and light tannins, they go with a wide variety of meats, pasta dishes, roast vegetables and risottos. Green apples, a wave of refreshing citrus, and subtle almonds. Gavi is a great match for seafood of all kinds. Try this with prawns, seafood risotto, or grilled sea bass. Medium-bodied with rounded red cherries and plums, and a soft rounded finish. This would be good with medium-bodied pasta dishes such as Bolognese, roast pork, or mushroom risotto.
