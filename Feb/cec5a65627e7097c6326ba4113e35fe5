St Brendan’s, Killarney 1-12 St Francis College, Rochestown 1-4 St Brendan’s successfully defended their Corn Uí Mhuirí (Munster Post-Primary Schools SFC) title and their 24th in all in a one-sided final against injury-ravaged St Francis College in Mallow on Saturday. The Kerry side led 0-5 to 0-3 at half-time, but dominated on the resumption by kicking five scores without response before a Seán Coakley goal offered the Cork school a lifeline in the 52nd minute. But St Brendan’s replied almost immediately with a cracking goal from man-of-the-match John Kelleher. The greater power of the new champions was evident throughout with Kelleher and Darren Ryan dictating midfield and Luke Crowley and Alex Hennigan contributing 0-8 between them. Full back and captain Cian Lynch marshalled a resolute defence.
