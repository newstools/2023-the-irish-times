A chara, – In 2016, schools around the country were presented with the Tricolour to commemorate the 1916 rising. These were ceremonial events involving the Army delivering the Tricolour to great applause, reverence and celebration. It is with sadness that I see signs of tattered, battered Tricolours displayed on flagpoles outside some schools and public buildings. We once held the Tricolour in such reverence, taking it indoors at night-time, and there were many guidelines and rules around it. While these rules are no longer obligatory, we should respect the Tricolour and remove a Tricolour that is tattered and worn. No Tricolour is better than a tattered one. – Is mise, MUIREANN NÍ CHONAILL, Rosenallis, Co Laois.
