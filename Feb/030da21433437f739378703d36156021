Primark owner Associated British Foods said on Monday its full 2022-23 year expectations have improved, with adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share now expected to be broadly in line with the previous financial year. The group, which also owns major sugar, grocery, agriculture and ingredients businesses, had previously forecast adjusted operating profit lower than the £1.4 billion (€1.6 billion). “Total sales in Europe, excluding the UK, are expected to increase by 18 per cent driven by higher footfall with growth in all our markets,” it said in a trading update on Monday. Like-for-like sales, meanwhile, are expected to be 8 per cent higher than 2021. However, the company said it expects margins in its food business to be narrower than expected as it continues to encounter “significant cost pressures”. The group’s share price, up almost 20 per cent this year, was down 0.2 per cent on Monday morning. - Additional reporting: Bloomberg (c) Copyright Thomson Reuters 2023
