Sergio Garcia has accused Rory McIlroy of lacking maturity about players joining LIV Golf and also blamed the Northern Irish golfer for ending their friendship after the latter left for the upstart circuit last year. “I think it is very sad,” Garcia, 43, told the Daily Telegraph on Thursday ahead of this weekend’s LIV season opener at Mayakoba. “I think that we’ve done so many things together and had so many experiences that for him to throw that away just because I decided to go to a different tour, well, it doesn’t seem very mature; lacking maturity, really. “But Rory’s got his own life, and he makes his own choices, the same way that I make mine. I respect his choices, but it seems like he doesn’t respect the ones I make. So, one-way street.” Garcia said he’d be open to clearing the air, but it doesn’t appear that will happen. “Sure, I don't have a problem with him,” Garcia said. “He's the one that has a problem. So if he wants to reconcile, then I'm willing to talk, but I'm not sure he'll put himself down to that level.” If the LIV players win an arbitration case that would allow them to remain on the DP World Tour, the rift between the two stars could grow deeper. It would allow Garcia – the all-time Ryder Cup points leader – and other LIV members earn points toward automatic qualification for the Ryder Cup. Also, if they play well enough but don’t automatically qualify, European captain Luke Donald could add them with any of his six wild-card selections. “I wouldn’t want to harm the atmosphere in the team room,” Garcia said. “I love that event too much for that.” (c) Copyright Field Level Media
