Sir, – Would someone please remind Boris Johnson that he is not the British prime minister any longer and, more importantly, the reason why that is? – Yours, etc, EITHNE MacFADDEN, Carrigart, Co Donegal. Sir, – Hopefully a resolution to the longstanding and needless Brexit impasse can at last be achieved; arguably the same position could have been reached at least a year ago had it not been vetoed for seemingly opportunistic purposes by the then British prime minister Boris Johnson and subsequently used by his record breaking successor Liz Truss to burnish her leadership credentials. In both instances, with no regard to the actual people of Northern Ireland. What is, however, quite galling are the reports that the man who was by all accounts briefed by his own civil service of the consequences and fallout of the protocol agreement, yet still chose to press ahead, is now the same person the press suggest is the one with potentially the final say. Having endured what he is responsible for creating, you would think any sensible person would be only too keen to ignore anything he offers as counsel? “Long Boris” is a condition we can all do without suffering. – Yours, etc, CRAIG DOUGLAS, Belfast.
