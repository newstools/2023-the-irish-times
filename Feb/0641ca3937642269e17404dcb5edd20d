Sir, – Amid all the disturbing news of our troubled world, it is always refreshing to turn to Thinking Anew and find a contribution from Rev Wendy May Jacobs. I found her words last Saturday particularly inspirational (“Attending to the victim – our restorative God”, February 11th). Long may she flourish. – Yours, etc, SYLVIA WIGHAM, Rathfarnham, Dublin 14.
