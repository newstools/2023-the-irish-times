An entertainment industry figure is to stand trial accused of defilement of a child aged under 17 more than a decade ago. The man in his thirties, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested on Tuesday morning and charged. There was no objection to bail when he appeared before Judge John Brennan at Dublin District Court in the afternoon. The judge said reporting restrictions applied in the case. The accused faces three charges of engaging in oral sex with a child, who was under 17 years of age, contrary to the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act, 2006, at two unknown locations in Dublin and one in the city centre, on dates in 2010 and early 2011. One incident allegedly occurred on December 14th; another on a date from August 2010 and before January 23rd 2011; while the third charge was on an unknown date in 2010. A Garda detective attached to a protective services unit gave evidence of arrest, charge and caution. The accused, represented in court by counsel, made “no reply” to the charges. The court heard the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) had directed trial on indictment. This means the case will be sent forward to the Circuit Court. The DPP also directed that the man could be sent forward for sentencing on a signed plea, should that arise. Judge Brennan remanded the accused on bail in his bond €500 to appear again in March to be served with a book of evidence and returned for trial. He also set a condition that there must no contact with the complainant. The accused did not have to address the court during the brief hearing and is yet to enter a plea. There was no legal aid application. After signing his bail bond, he walked from the Criminal Courts of Justice about an hour and a half later.
