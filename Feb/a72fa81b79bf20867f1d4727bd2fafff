I’ve been making a variation of this chickpea curry for many years. It’s a staple in our house and something I cook often, when we need something fast, nutritious and delicious. You can add leftover chicken, vegetables, tofu or prawns. It’s super versatile. I love it with rice or thick udon noodles. To add an extra protein boost to this dish, I often cook rice in home-made chicken stock using the absorption method, two cups of liquid to one cup of rice. The rice tastes so good this way. This curry has a slightly fruity tropical twist. Most shops now have their own brand of frozen fruit mixes available. I love the tropical fruit smoothie mixes and use the pineapple for pizzas, the mango for curries and the papaya for smoothies. These are fruits that don’t grow in Ireland and are often shipped here underripe, so buying them frozen can ensure they are at peak ripeness and in best possible condition. I’m always amazed at the versatility of chickpeas. From hummus to crispy chickpeas straight from the air fryer, they’re always there to provide a nutritious boost. I also mash them with lemon juice, mayonnaise and some nori flakes to make a sandwich filling that tastes very similar to tuna. One of my secret weapons in the kitchen is nigella seeds, also known as black onion seed, black cumin or kalonji. They come from the seeds of the flowering plant Nigella Sativa. I find them invaluable: the tiny little black seeds are most commonly used in Indian, Middle Eastern and North African cuisine. They’re the crunchy, flavoursome seeds found on naan. They have a slightly bitter taste that’s so distinctive. They’re also associated with many health benefits. I incorporate them in bread dough and flatbreads, crackers and to garnish dishes such as curry or spiced roasted vegetables. Recipe: Mango chickpea curry
