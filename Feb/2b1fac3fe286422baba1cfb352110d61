Police have been given further time to question a suspect in the attempted murder of an off-duty police officer in Omagh, Co Tyrone. It comes after a sixth man was arrested in connection with the shooting. In a statement, the PSNI said the 71-year-old man was arrested on Saturday evening in the Killyclogher Road area of Omagh under the Terrorism Act and taken to Musgrave Serious Crime Suite to be questioned about the shooting of Det Chief Insp John Caldwell. Five men aged 22, 38, 43, 45 and 47 years old remain in police custody in connection with the shooting. Police on Sunday evening were granted more time to question the 43-year-old suspect. [ Omagh shooting: why do dissident republicans persist despite little support and no clear strategy? ] “A court in Belfast has granted an extension to the detention of the suspect until 10pm on Tuesday, February 28,” a PSNI spokesperson said. “All six arrested men remain in custody in the Serious Crime Suite at Musgrave Police Station.” Mr Caldwell remains critically ill in hospital and it is understood he has suffered life-changing injuries. He was shot in front of his young son  at a sports complex where he had been coaching a youth team on Wednesday evening in an attack suspected to be linked to  dissident republican group the New IRA. Police believe two gunmen involved fired multiple shots. [ Omagh shooting: ‘Everyone ran to help without thinking of the danger’ ] Mr Caldwell ran a short distance and fell to the ground while  the attackers continued to fire at him as children ran to safety, police said. He was operated on immediately after the attack and  underwent further surgery on Thursday afternoon. There were gatherings in Beragh and Omagh on Saturday in solidarity with Mr Caldwell and his family. Police have asked for the public’s help in the investigation, and have appealed to witnesses or those with information to get in touch by calling 101 or online via http://www.psni.police.uk/makeareport/.
