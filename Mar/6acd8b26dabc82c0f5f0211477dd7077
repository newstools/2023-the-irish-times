1. For the filling, peel and de-core the apples and chop them. Add into a pan with the sugar, syrup, water and cinnamon. Cook until the apples are just soft and the liquid is reduced. Allow to cool. 2. For the pastry, beat the butter and sugar in a bowl (or you can use a stand mixer with the paddle attachment). Add one whole egg and one egg yolk and mix until combined. Add the flour in three batches, until a dough is formed. Tip out on to a lightly floured surface and knead the dough for a few minutes, until it is a little warm and softer. Gently work the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film and chill it for 45 minutes. 3. Remove the pastry from the fridge and cut in half. Roll out the pastry, using a rolling pin, and line a deep baking pie tin (20cm in diameter). Sit the pastry into the tin (leaving a little hanging over the sides) and then fill the pastry with the cold apple mix. Roll out the other half of pastry and place on top, sealing the edges with a little bit of egg yolk. Brush a light layer of egg yolk on top, dust with some sugar and cook for 45 minutes at 175 degrees. Remove from the oven and allow to cool. 4. For the caramel: Melt the sugar in a wide-based pan. Once the sugar starts to caramelise (turns golden brown), add the syrup. Add the butter and cream and cook out until it reduces to your desired consistency. Be very careful as the caramel will be very hot. Drizzle the caramel on top of the pie, add the roasted hazelnuts and serve with some whipped cream.
