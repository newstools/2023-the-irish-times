Sir, – Reports that Ireland may partner with a new Nato initiative to protect undersea infrastructure is indeed welcome news (“Ireland ‘interested’ in joining Nato undersea security cell, says senior alliance figure”, News, March 6th). Undersea data and power infrastructure are key enablers for our economy, and the ability to monitor and protect same is vital. Unfortunately, due to the ongoing severe crisis in the Defence Forces, particularly within the Naval Service, we are unable to police or monitor our waters and area of interest effectively. Government first needs to address the crisis by ensuring that pay, allowances, and conditions of service are attractive for members of the Defence Forces, which will address the problem of retention. The continuing loss of skilled personnel has led to a number of Naval Service vessels being taken out of service and a reduction in our ability to patrol our waters. Given the continuing deterioration in the European security environment, the ability to monitor and protect vital strategic infrastructure is essential. Closer cooperation with our European partners and addressing the crisis in our Defence Forces is key. – Yours, etc, CONOR HOGARTY, Blackrock, Co Dublin.
