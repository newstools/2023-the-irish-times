The former minister for arts Jimmy Deenihan has stepped down from the board of Listowel Writers’ Week, but says his resignation is not linked to an ongoing row over restructuring. The long-standing literary festival has been the subject of controversy since the disbanding of its voluntary committee last year on foot of a recommendation by an independent consultant. [ A town divided: What’s going on at Listowel Writers’ Week? ] The report on governance by consultant Dermot McLaughlin was funded by the Arts Council and presented to the board. A professional festival curator, Stephen Connolly, was appointed in December. Chairwoman Catherine Moylan said at the time that the appointment was one of a series of recommendations in the consultant’s report. In November, author Colm Tóibín stepped down from the festival board because of the decision to disband the volunteers. Leading writers including Roddy Doyle and Edna O’Brien have also expressed concern. Mr Deenihan confirmed he had “stepped down” from the board of the festival but said this was because he was cutting back on his board directorships and would also be resigning from the charity Goal. He said the board of Writ’ers Week was well-structured that its members highly competent and they included a barrister and solicitor.
