Kildare has always felt more like two counties than one, with the north of the county – the towns of Leixlip, Maynooth, Kilcock and Celbridge – being more associated with Dublin city than the county town of Naas and the shopping meccas of Newbridge and Kildare in the south. With the county council offices in Naas, the county GAA grounds in Newbridge as well as Whitewater Shopping Centre, and Kildare having, of course, its famous village shopping outlet, it feels like a tale of two counties. And the prices reflect this, with houses frequently achieving about €500,000 in the north of the county and a more modest baseline of €400,000 – €450,000 around the central towns. The further down the M7 you go, the more you’ll find knocked off house prices: proximity to Dublin has always been key, with a huge cohort of the county commuting to the capital. Naas is more expensive than Newbridge, which trumps Kildare, which beats Monasterevin and so on. All the big property players have a significant presence in the county, with Cairn, Ballymore, Glenveagh and Westin among those involved in the delivery of estates of 350-plus homes. While the building of new houses continues apace, the prices on offer are more likely to be within the reach of trader-uppers rather than first-time buyers, and a huge issue across the county is school places, particularly at secondary level, where no new schools have been built in the last few years.
