Scottie Scheffler has a two-shot lead at the Players Championship at the close of the third round at Sawgrass. The Masters champion moved to 14 under with a 65, with Min Woo Lee just behind on 12 under. A new course record was set by Tom Hoge, the American, with a 10-under 62. Englishmen Tommy Fleetwood and Aaron Rai are five off the lead. Rai made a hole in one at the 17th, making it the first time the tournament has ever had multiple holes-in-one in the same week after Hayden Buckley made one in the first round. Scheffler will return to the world number one spot if he wins the title on Sunday. Shane Lowry was the only Irish player to make the cut, and he had a good day on Saturday also, shooting a four-under-par 68 that included six birdies. After his opening 77 however, he is well back, 12 off the lead in tied 47th place. Earlier in the day, Rory McIlroy failed to make the cut as the second round was finally completed on Saturday following storm delays. The Northern Irishman missed out by three shots after finishing the second round with a one-over-par 73 on Friday, following on from a first-round 76. “It’s just the time management,” said McIlroy, who also organises players-only meetings and serves as a player director on the Tour Policy Board. “The golf out here, that’s fine, but it’s just more the time at home to make sure you’re getting prepared, to make sure that you’re doing everything you can to be ready once you show up to these weeks. “That’s where I’ve maybe sacrificed a little bit of time with some of this other stuff.”
