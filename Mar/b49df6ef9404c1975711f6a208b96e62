The four-day event is an annual paradise for Irish horse racing fans - whether they make the trip to Gloucestershire or not. The 2023 edition will feature 28 races, with the big ones including the Champion Hurdle on Tuesday, Champion Chase on Wednesday, Ryanair Chase and Stayers Hurdle on Thursday, and the big, big one, the Gold Cup, on Friday afternoon. - Tuesday-Friday, UTV & Virgin Media No, not that one. We suspect you will probably be watching the Ireland v England clash in the Six Nations next Saturday. However, the following day, is another major game between the two sides - in the under-20 Six Nations. Ireland have had a very successful tournament – winning all four matches to date - but the winner of the championship has still to be decided. It will be settled in Musgrave Park this weekend. Ireland are defending champions, having won the Grand Slam last year. They are currently three points clear of France and four ahead of England. With France hot favourites to beat Wales in Oyonnax, Ireland know victory is almost certainly needed to retain the title. - Sunday, Virgin Media & BBC Red Button If you keep half an eye on Italian football, you might know that next weekend is moving day – when all the sides chasing the top spots in the league have big games. Sunday, in particular, has three big games. Napoli, who haven’t won a title in so long Diego Maradona was on the team, are currently top of Serie A and travel to Torino, who are chasing a European football spot. Fierce rivals Lazio and Roma are locked in a battle with the two Milan giants for Champions League spots, and they meet at Stadio Olimpio in the Rome derby. And, if that wasn’t enough, there is the small matter of Inter Milan hosting Juventus. Super Sunday, Italian style. - Sunday, BT Sport
