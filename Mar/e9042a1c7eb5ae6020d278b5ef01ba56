I was recently chatting to a friend who complained there were no strawberries or tomatoes in the shops. We were in a local cafe with a gale blowing outside, peeling off our coats and scarves, leaving our umbrellas at the door. I know this soft fruit shortage has nothing to do with our weather, and more to do with bad weather hitting crops in countries such as Morocco and Spain, as we almost always import them this time of year. But it does really make us refocus our attention on what is available. What is growing now here on our lovely green island? Wonderful root vegetables for one, such as beetroot, celeriac, parsnips and carrots. Brave leeks, cabbage and kale are also emerging. Bord Bia has a really convenient “best in season” calendar on its website that is worth checking out. It is also evident at any farmers’ market or farm shop what is available now. Eating seasonally is more affordable and means that we’re supporting Irish farmers while getting vegetables that are at their peak and best quality. I love beetroot and have been juicing them with ginger, carrots and apples. Roasting them brings out their natural sugars, but they’re equally good grated raw into a salad or coleslaw. Due to their distinctive earthy taste, they pair really well with other bold flavours such as citrus and spice. Here I’ve coated them in harissa paste, along with some leeks, and roasted them for a spicy, warm and punchy vegetable dish. I’ve always soaked bulgur wheat in a sealed lunch box to get it toothsome yet fluffy. Some creamy, salty feta and crunchy toasted pumpkin seeds finish the dish perfectly. It’s ideal as Sunday night meal preparation for the week ahead. It makes the perfect lunch or supper on its own but is equally good with a roast chicken.
