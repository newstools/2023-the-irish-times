Let’s take a look at two wines from perhaps less well-known European wine-producing countries this week. Both are capable of producing excellent wines, in this case using their own unique grapes. Grüner Veltliner is to be found almost exclusively in Austria. The wines come in various styles, from refreshing and racy to rich and powerful. The wine below is a classic example of the lighter style. Portugal has many excellent indigenous grapes, both red and white. The wine below is a blend of several varieties: Touriga Nacional, Touriga Franca, Tinta Barroca and Tinta Roriz. The Douro is more famous for Port, but it produces very good white and red wines too. 13% abv. Plump easy-going lightly spicy peaches. This would go nicely with mild Thai curries or pasta with prawns. €7.69 from Lidl. 13% abv. Soft ripe strawberries and tobacco with a smooth finish. Try this with grilled pork chops or chicken. €7.95 from Lidl.
