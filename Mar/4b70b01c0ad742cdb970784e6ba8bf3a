Sir, – In response to the proposed referendum or referendums on the Constitution, the National Women’s Council said that the proposed constitutional change would “recognise the reality of women’s lives and ambitions in modern Irish society” (News, March 7th). But it is a sad reality, lacking cause for celebration, that mothers today are obliged by economic necessity, rather than career ambition, to engage in labour outside of the home and away from their families. Stay-at-home parenting is a privilege afforded to too few, and is disproportionately reserved for the middle classes. Most mothers would choose to spend more time, not less, with their children. Rather than rewriting the Constitution, politicians would serve women better by renewing efforts to make its present message ring true – alleviating financial barriers to being a mother working in the home would offer women actual choice as to how they spend their time. – Yours, etc, PORTIA BERRY-KILBY, Sudbury, Suffolk, England.
