Sir, – According to your headline, fare-free travel would “incentivise excessive journeys” (News, March 9th). The French philosopher Blaise Pascal, writing in the 17th century, declared that the sole cause of man’s unhappiness stems from not being able to stay quietly in his room. The pity is that the National Transport Authority had to commission an independent report to confirm Pascal’s aphorism. – Yours, etc, COLUM MacDONNELL, Glenageary, Co Dublin. Sir, – An increase in “unnecessary travel”? What would that look like? Going to the beach? Going to the cinema? Going to meet friends? – Yours, etc, PAT QUINN, Inchicore, Dublin 8.
