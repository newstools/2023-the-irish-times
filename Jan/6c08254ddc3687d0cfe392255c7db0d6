A former hurler was killed in a Co Kilkenny single-vehicle crash early on Friday morning. James “Shiner” Nolan (34), died when the car he was driving hit a wall at Carn in Dunbell, Co Kilkenny, at 2.30am. Mr Nolan, who played for his local Clara GAA club and previously for the county senior team, was pronounced dead at the scene by emergency services a short time later. His body was removed to St Luke’s General Hospital in Kilkenny. A postmortem will be carried out at University Hospital Waterford. The road was closed for several hours to allow for an examination of the scene by Garda investigators but has now reopened. Mr Nolan worked on the family farm with his father Gerry. The Nolan family suffered another tragedy several decades ago, when two of his older brothers died in a slurry tank accident. He was also a cousin of 13-year-old Harry Byrne who died following an accident at St Kieran’s College in Kilkenny city in November 2021. The boy was taken to St Luke’s General Hospital after being accidentally hit by a sliotar in the head while playing with friends
