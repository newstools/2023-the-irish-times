Sir, – As a taxi driver, I have frequent need of car servicing and repair, but to my shock I have found that such the cost of such services has doubled, and in some cases trebled. A few months ago, an average car service would have cost me €140. This week I paid €201 for exactly the same work to be carried out. I also, on advice from the garage, need to replace brake pads and discs, front, and rear. Not so long ago , I would have paid in the region of €220 for this; this week I was quoted nearly €500 for this work. I honestly believe everyone is jumping on the bandwagon with price increases, and putting it all down to the war in Ukraine, when in fact most of these increases have nothing whatever to do with the war. – Yours, etc, PAUL O’BEIRNE, Beaumont, Dublin 9.
