Sir, – I quite like election posters as they create a sense of occasion. They give business to printers and creative photographers and designers, who beautify and enhance the candidates as they look benignly down upon us, while also gazing defiantly into the prosperous future that electing them will guarantee. I also like them as they define a constituency as one drives about. Like others, however, I get cranky when they overstay their welcome. They can be recycled by writing on the back to promote other events or protests. Indeed they can and are used as posters, erected hither and yon, for Christmas fairs, festivals, pantomimes, etc, that still litter our roundabouts and fences long after the festive season has abated. And no stiff fines from local authorities that out of date election posters are uniquely subjected to. – Yours, etc, TOMÁS FINN, Cappataggle, Ballinasloe, Co Galway.
