I’ve been obsessed with hot honey, a spicy sweet condiment, for the past few years. It really elevates everything I use it with. A classic potato and leek soup is brought to another level with a drizzle of this. It is amazing over pizza, fried chicken, feta cheese or salad. It’s wonderful stuff and so easy to make your own. I’ve been getting weekly vegetable deliveries for the past few months in an effort to cut down on dashes to the supermarket and on food packaging, as well as encouraging us to eat more vegetables, and as a way to support Irish farmers. The delivery is from a farm in Galway, Green Earth Organics, and at this time of year always includes some amazing Irish-grown root vegetables. I admit I don’t usually rush to add turnips, beetroot and parsnips to my shopping trolley, but over the past few months we’ve eaten many as a result of these weekly deliveries. It has been great to cook so seasonably and have more vegetable-centred meals. One of my favourite ways to make the most of the humble root vegetable is to roast them. The high heat brings out the sweetness, and paired with a spicy hot honey they really are delicious. As well as being tasty, these vegetables are wonderful sources of prebiotics. Prebiotics are the non-digestible carbohydrates that act as “food” for probiotics, helping them grow and remain in your digestive system. I’ve also added a creamy herb-flecked yoghurt for even more gut friendliness. This dish makes a real feast of seasonal root vegetables.
