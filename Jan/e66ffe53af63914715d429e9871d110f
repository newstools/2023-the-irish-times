Brazilian president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva worked from his office, meeting the country’s governors, heads of congress and the supreme court a day after Brazil’s capital was stormed by his predecessor’s supporters. “We are not going to allow democracy to slip out of our hands, Lula said at the meeting. “They want a coup, and there won’t be a coup. All 27 governors accepted Lula’s invitation – even allies of former president Jair Bolsonaro – to meet in the Palácio do Planalto, damaged by Bolsonaro supporters the day before.

Many of them said they wanted the Brazilian army to restore the far-right Mr Bolsonaro to power and oust the newly inaugurated leftist president.

Mr Bolsonaro has been admitted to a US hospital with abdominal pain a day after his supporters stormed Brasília. The conservative leader, who travelled to the United States on December 30th to skip the inauguration of his successor, is reportedly being treated at a hospital near Orlando, Florida. A former aide to Bolsonaro said he was being treated for possible intestinal obstruction. The ex-president has undergone several surgeries after being stabbed in the abdomen while campaigning in 2018. The former president on Monday evening posted a photograph of himself on his Twitter page showing him in a hospital bed, adding that he’s in Orlando. “Thanks for the prayers and messages of speedy recovery, he said. – Agencies
