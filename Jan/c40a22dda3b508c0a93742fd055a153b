For those of you not partaking in a dry January, two classic French wines from O’Briens, both offering good value for money if your finances are stretched. The sauvignon is labelled as a Vin de France, but I suspect most if not all of the grapes come from the Loire Valley, giving it a lovely freshness. The red, from sunny Languedoc, in the south of France, will bring warmth and cheer to the dinner table. A refreshing crisp, dry wine with fresh pear and apple fruits. Perfect on its own, with lighter seafood dishes or goat’s cheese. A rich, rounded full-bodied red with ripe dark fruits and a subtle spiciness. Perfect for the cold winter weather. Try it with a beef stew or roast red meats, or hearty Mediterranean vegetarian tray bake.
