1. First make the dressing. Place all the dressing ingredients into a high-sided jug and blitz with a hand-held blender or process in a blender until smooth. Set aside. 2. Place the sliced red pepper, thinly sliced cabbage, kohlrabi and spring onion into a bowl. Peel the carrots into ribbons and add to the bowl along with the cucumber and coriander. Mix gently to combine. Fold in the cooked noodles if using. 3. Just before serving coat the vegetables with the dressing, just enough to make the mixture glisten. Sprinkle generously with the peanuts and a little extra coriander.
