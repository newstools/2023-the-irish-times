Sir, – The third Monday of January has been dubbed “Blue Monday” due to its reputation as the most depressing day of the year. While the concept of Blue Monday is largely a myth, the idea of this Monday being a particularly difficult day for many people is not. Factors such as dark mornings, post-Christmas blues, cold winter weather, and the end of the Christmas holidays can contribute significantly to feelings of despair. The new year is often a time for reflection and goal setting, but it is also when there will be an influx of toxic positivity in our social media feeds. It is important to remember that all emotions are normal and valid. It is perfectly normal to be feeling down on Blue Monday – or any other day. We should strive to practise healthy positivity, which means allowing ourselves to feel and express our emotions instead of pretending everything is fine when it is not. It’s also important to remember that if we are struggling, we don’t have to feel ashamed. Seeking professional help from an accredited counsellor or psychotherapist can be a helpful way to deal with the ups and downs of life. It is important to be mindful of mental health during this time and to remember that it is completely natural to feel a bit blue in January. While Blue Monday can be a reminder of the difficulty of life, it can also be an opportunity to practise healthy positivity and to take care of our mental health. – Yours, etc, SÉAMUS SHEEDY, MIACP Cathaoirleach, Irish Association of Counselling and Psychotherapy, Tullamore, Co Offaly.
