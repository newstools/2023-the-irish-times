Sir, – Further to recent correspondence (Letters, January 27th), I will never understand why so many people hate January. November is much worse: it’s dark at 4pm, and it’s a very lonely month for anyone living alone, with a long winter stretching ahead. January gets brighter each day, with buds appearing on trees and spring flowers beginning to emerge, and the prospect of months of light and warmer days. – Yours, etc, MARGARET BUTLER, Booterstown, Co Dublin.
