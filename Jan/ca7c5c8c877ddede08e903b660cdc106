The refugee processing centre at Citywest is likely to close for new arrivals within a matter of days, Minister for Integration Roderic O’Gorman has said. “There is a very real risk that we won’t be able to accommodate everyone”, he told RTÉ Radio’s News at One. Families and vulnerable people will be prioritised but there are “difficult weeks ahead”, he said. “It’s becoming increasingly difficult to secure new accommodation” to meet the needs of new arrivals, explained the minister. Government Ministers are preparing for a scenario whereby the same number of refugees may arrive into the country this year as the nearly 70,000 that came in 2022. There is also a significant shortfall of accommodation predicted for international protection applicants, separate to those fleeing the war in Ukraine. Mr O’Gorman said it was difficult to “get line of sight” for potential accommodation, it would be mid-February before any more became available and it would be Easter before 200 modular units providing 800 beds became available. The closure of City West in the next few days will be the third time the centre has had to stop taking in new arrivals, previous closures were for short periods of time, but on this occasion it “could be for a longer period”, Mr O’Gorman said, possibly a number of weeks. There was a small facility at Dublin Airport where people could stay overnight if they arrived on a late flight, but it was not a long term facility, he said. With the closure of the Citywest facility there was “a very real risk” that the country could not accommodate all arrivals. When asked about hotels providing long term accommodation for Ukrainian refugees, Mr O’Gorman said that a “significant number” had signed new “bed only” contracts and that the number that had “very clearly indicated no” was “quite small”.
