Cork 3-14 Tipperary 1-19 Cork came from six points down with five minutes’ regulation time remaining to snatch the Munster League title from Tipperary in greasy conditions at a gloomy Páirc Uí Rinn on Sunday. Few in the 4,727 attendance could have envisaged such an outcome as Jason Forde appeared to be steering his side to a fifth title but Cork finished strongly to land only their second triumph and the first since 2017. Forde pointed for the 14th time to leave Tipp 1-18 to 2-9 in front after 65 minutes only for Cork to storm back, boosted by a Jack O’Connor goal, three minutes later, and a point almost immediately. Brian Roche restored parity for only the third time approaching 70 minutes. Patrick Horgan’s free nudged Cork in front in the first of three minutes’ injury-time only for Forde to respond in kind. Horgan hit the winner from a free, 30 seconds from the end. Tipp finished the first-half strongly to lead 1-9 to 1-6 at the interval. Cork were 1-6 to 0-5 ahead after 21 minutes, Horgan scoring the goal in the fifth minute but Tipp struck 1-3 without response. A neat one-two between Sean Ryan and Conor Stakelum yielded a Ryan goal after 25 minutes. Inspired by wing back Brian McGrath, Tipp bossed most of the second-half with Forde unstoppable though a goal from substitute Brian Hayes after 55 minutes kept Cork in the hunt, 1-16 to 2-9. Forde kept the scoreboard ticking over but Cork’s desire got them over the line.
