Following a successful night at the Golden Globes, the team behind Martin McDonagh’s The Banshees of Inisherin will be delighted to have landed five nominations at the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) awards. As at the Globes, four performers from the Irish film were mentioned. Banshees also landed a nomination for “performance by a cast”. The film tied for most nominations with rising science-fiction comedy Everything Everywhere All at Once. There was, however, disappointment for two domestic performers. Jessie Buckley, a standout in Sarah Polley’s Women Talking, could reasonably have hoped for a place in the best supporting actress race. Paul Mescal, highly praised for his turn in Charlotte Wells’s Aftersun, was tipped for a best actor slot. Neither registered with SAG, but still have a chance when the Oscar nominations land in two weeks. The Banshees of Inisherin could not have performed any better. Colin Farrell, winner at the Globes, is up for best male actor. Barry Keoghan and Brendan Gleeson compete in best male supporting actor. Kerry Condon is on the shortlist for best supporting female actor. With such an array of nominations, a “cast” mention might seem inevitable, but, last year, The Power of the Dog registered three without landing in that ensemble race. [ Golden Globes 2023: The Banshees of Inisherin wins three awards as Colin Farrell takes best actor ] [ The Banshees of Inisherin film review: An impeccable cast eats up the succulent dialogue ] Over the last decade that particular award has been a pointer to success at the Academy Awards. Unexpected victories in ensemble for Coda and Parasite at the SAG awards swung hitherto unconvinced oddsmakers round to the eventual winners of the best picture Oscar. Drawing votes from members of the now combined Screen Actors Guild and American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the body inevitably gives some clues as what way the largest branch in the academy –  the actors – might be leaning. All four winners of the acting prizes at SAG last year went on to convert at the Oscars. The voters at SAG do, however, tend to be a little more conservative. Mescal need not be too concerned that Adam Sandler landed a surprise place in best male actor for the Netflix sports drama Hustle. Aftersun does sound more like an Oscar film. Buckley will take Women Talking’s ensemble nomination as a hopeful sign. She may also recall that, after being snubbed at SAG last year, she still landed an Oscar nomination for The Lost Daughter. It was announced today that this year’s show, on February 26th, will be broadcast via Netflix’s YouTube channel before moving globally to that streaming service in 2024. The Oscar nominations arrive on January 24th.
