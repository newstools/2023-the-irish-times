Sir, – Further to “Glen lodge official objection to result of All-Ireland final against Kilmacud Crokes” (Sport, January 24th), in rugby, soccer, and American football, the issue of too many players on the pitch is handled under the rules by the match officials at the time the transgression is detected. There is no provision for resolution by committee. Surely the simplest way to handle this is for the match officials at the time to control the admission and exit of players to and from the playing field. – Yours, etc, JOHN FAGAN, Killiney, Co Dublin. Sir, – I’m thinking of slipping on a third player for the crucial points (only for a few seconds at a time, mind) in my tennis league doubles match this weekend. Unless the opposition object in writing within three days, do you think we should be okay? – Yours, etc, PAUL GREGAN, Bray, Co Wicklow.
