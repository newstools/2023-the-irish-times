Sir, – Derek Scally’s powerful article “Germany embraces new approach to uphold vow to never forget the Holocaust” (World, January 28th) details recent developments about Holocaust remembrance in Germany. Here in Ireland, the national Holocaust Memorial Day commemoration, which was initiated in 2003, has always been an inclusive event. The Irish commemoration cherishes the memory of all people who perished in the Holocaust and recalls the millions of innocent Jewish men, women and children as well as all victims, who were persecuted and murdered because of their ethnicity, disability, sexual orientation, political affiliations or their religious beliefs. The commemoration takes the form of a ceremony that includes readings, survivors’ recollections, the Scroll of Names, candle-lighting and music. Representatives of all of the victim groups participate in the event and it is attended by people from all walks of Irish life. Felix Klein, the German federal commissioner for antisemitism, who is mentioned in the article, will deliver the annual Holocaust Memorial lecture in Dublin Castle on February 15th. We have a handful of Jewish survivors here in Ireland who were themselves victims of the Holocaust. With each passing year, we are mindful of their declining numbers as we undertake to tell their stories and remember what happened to their families and their compatriots, along with the victims of so many other minorities. – Yours, etc, THOMAS O’DOWD Chairperson, Holocaust Education Ireland, Dublin 2.
