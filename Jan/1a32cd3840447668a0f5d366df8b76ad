Romanian authorities said they have seized goods and money worth 18 million lei (€3.7 million) as a part of a criminal inquiry into alleged human trafficking that led to the arrest of divisive internet personality Andrew Tate. In the past week, the National Agency for the Management of Seized Assets has taken into administration 29 movable assets, including luxury vehicles and watches, and various amounts of cash in different currencies, it said in a statement late on Saturday. On Saturday, several cars, including a Rolls-Royce, BMW and Mercedes-Benz, were taken from Tate’s compound on the outskirts of the capital, Bucharest, to be transported to a storage location. Tate, his brother and two Romanian female suspects were detained on December 29th on charges of forming a criminal gang to exploit six women sexually. They have denied wrongdoing.

Andrew Tate, a former contestant on the UK reality show Big Brother, gained notoriety for misogynistic remarks and hate speech. His remarks got him banned from all major social media platforms, although his Twitter account became active again in November after Elon Musk acquired the platform. - Reuters
