Sir, – If one good result could be achieved out of the poster affair, it would be the abolition of posters and their replacement with public information boards, as is the case in the Netherlands. In the programme for government in June 2020, we were promised a review prior to the 2024 local elections. I implore all parties to abandon posters and respect the wishes of the public. – Yours, etc, PAUL F DUBSKY, Ballymoney, Co Wexford. Sir, – The Opposition is trying its best to bring forward the general election. Toppling Ministers seems to be the strategy of choice. Everyone makes mistakes: some minor, some far more serious. Regardless of the severity of the error, surely our Dáil chamber is not the place for the bickering and the appalling hostile discourse we are currently witnessing. – Yours, etc, MARY BARRETT, Dublin 5. Sir, – It troubles me greatly when I read and hear of how this gentleman is being treated by some of his parliamentary colleagues. Paschal Donohoe has done more for this country than all of them combined. Mr Donohoe has steered our country through one of the most challenging financial episodes of our times, and our current positive economic position bears testament to this fact. This is a man of high intellect and integrity and, dare I say, humanity. If he has a question to answer, so be it; however, he certainly does not deserve to be hounded in this manner. Please, “call off the hounds”. – Yours, etc, ROSE GILMARTIN, Dublin 14. Sir, – Our elected representatives still can’t see the wood for the trees. They have spent hours castigating Paschal Donohoe over his election expenses while saying very little about spending €2.5 billion repairing defective apartments. The plain people of Ireland are more interested in the latter. – Yours, etc, PAUDIE COMMANE, Tralee, Co Kerry. Sir, – Paschal Donohoe, the poster boy of Irish politics. – Yours, etc, DAVID CURRAN, Knocknacarra, Galway.
