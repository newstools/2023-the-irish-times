It added that France had a month to pull its troops out of Burkina Faso. The decision is a sign of a further deterioration of relations between France and its former colony since a September 2022 military coup. Some of the tension revolves around perceptions that France's military presence in Burkina Faso has not improved security in the insurgent-hit West African country.
