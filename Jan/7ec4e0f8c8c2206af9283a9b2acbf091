Several batches of expired Western Brand raw chicken products are being recalled from supermarkets by the The Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) due to possible Salmonella. The FSAI said the chicken products were sold as fresh and are past their use-by date. The products were labelled as suitable for home freezing - however, the FSAI advised consumers not to eat the affected batches, should they have them in their freezers. Recall notices will be displayed at the point of sale of the products, the FSAI said. The products were sold in Aldi, Glenmore, Dunnes Stores, Lidl and Tesco, and included chicken wings, chicken breast fillets, chicken legs, boneless thighs and mini fillets. A full list of the products, as well as their use-by-dates and batch numbers, can be found on the FSAI website under the food alert listings. People infected with salmonella typically develop symptoms between 12 and 36 hours after infection, but this can range between six and 72 hours. The most common symptom is diarrhoea, while other symptoms may include fever, headache and abdominal cramps. The illness usually lasts four to seven days. The elderly, infants, and those with impaired immune systems are likely to have a severe illness, and diarrhoea associated with salmonella infection can occasionally be severe enough to requrie hospital admission.
