Sir, – You report that the review into Ireland’s abortion law is currently examining conscientious objection on the part of medical practitioners (“Research on conscientious objection ‘vital’ before final report submitted, says abortion review chair”, News, January 9th). This was a key promise during the 2018 referendum to respect the rights of doctors not to go against their principles and be compelled to end a human life. If anything, freedom of conscience protections need to be strengthened not weakened in law. It is important that the review hears the perspective of pro-life doctors on conscientious objection, and it is clear this has not happened to date. In shaping the review, Minister for Health Stephen Donnelly met Start Doctors (Southern Task-Force On Abortion & Reproductive Topics), as well as other groups that strongly support abortion. However, there has been no such meetings with groups representing pro-life doctors by either the Minister for Health or the chair of the review. Before the review reaches its conclusion, these views should be sought and listened to. – Yours, etc, EILÍS MULROY, Pro Life Campaign, Dublin 2.
