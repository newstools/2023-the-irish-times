Sir, – Students wishing to apply to study medicine through the CAO are required to sit the health professions admission test (Hpat) at a cost of €152.80 per person. This is charged to all students, regardless of their background or family’s financial circumstances. How can this be deemed a suitable assessment tool for entry to the medical profession when it creates a huge financial burden on some families and not others? The college entry system has taken some steps to address inequity with the Higher Education Access Route, which reduces points for students who meet their criteria. The Student Universal Support Ireland (Susi) grant is available for eligible students to help with the cost of attending college. But the Hpat has no such steps available for students. Therefore students who cannot pay the €152.80 cannot apply for medicine courses. This creates further elitism in medicine, which is not only outrageously unjust for students but is detrimental to society in the longer term. This must be addressed without delay. A concession must be made available for students to access this exam when their financial circumstances will not cover the fee. – Yours, etc, LAURA O’FLANAGAN, Drumcondra, Dublin 9.
