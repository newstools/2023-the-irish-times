Bast-based scientific software company SciLeads said it will create up to 50 jobs in the next two years, doubling its workforce as the company plans to expand its business. The company is predicting it will need up to 100 staff by 2024 to deal with demand for its products, as it eyes further expansion in Asia. The new roles will be in sales and software development. SciLeads has already appointed a senior product manager, head of people and culture, and head of new business. SciLeads, which was established in 2016 by chief executive Daniel McRitchie, Laura Haldane and James Campbell, offers a lead generation and market intelligence platform to help scientific companies identify and engage with buyers, with a comprehensive database of scientific researchers who may need their products for their research. It started out with 20 staff, and reached 50 employees at the end of 2022. Mr McRitchie said SciLeads has ”massive potential” to grow further, and was open to investment to help progress those plans. The majority of its customer base - 93 per cent - is outside the UK, and its customers range from start-ups to Fortune 500 organisations. Although the majority of SciLeads’ workforce is based in the UK and Canada, it is fully remote, which could help the company overcome the challenges presented by demand for tech skills. “Finding talent in today’s market is definitely a challenge, particularly on the technical side,” said Ms Haldane, co-founder and vice president of sales and marketing at SciLeads. “However, our remote first working has helped us to overcome this by hiring anywhere in the world, as well as being flexible with our current staff.”
