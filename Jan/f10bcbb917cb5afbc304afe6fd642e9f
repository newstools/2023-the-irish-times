Sir, – In 2001, we were issued a pill by the then-government (yes, one pill) to help us deal with nuclear fallout. The pill had a shelf life of seven years, but I lost mine after a few months. I am greatly relieved to read that our Government is monitoring the Ukrainian situation (“State monitoring nuclear risk as a consequence of fighting in Ukraine”, News, January 9th). May I expect an anti-radiation pill or two anytime soon? I would be able to sleep better. – Yours, etc, BRAIN LOUGHEED, Sandymount, Dublin 4.
