Chelsea have completed the signing of Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk. The Ukraine international has signed an eight-and-a-half-year deal, with the Blues paying Shakhtar a reported €70 million (£62 million) – possibly rising to €100 million (£88m). The 22-year-old was in attendance for Chelsea’s game against Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge on Sunday. “I’m so happy to sign for Chelsea,” Mudryk told the club’s website. “This is a huge club, in a fantastic league and it is a very attractive project for me at this stage of my career. I’m excited to meet my new team-mates and I’m looking forward to working and learning under Graham Potter and his staff.” Mudryk had looked poised to sign for London rivals Arsenal before a last-minute intervention from recruitment head Paul Winstanley and co-owner Behdad Eghbali on Saturday, with the pair flying to Turkey to negotiate the deal.
