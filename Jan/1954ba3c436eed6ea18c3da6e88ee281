Sir, – At long last, we have an admission from Eirgrid’s chief executive Mark Foley that nuclear energy deserves a long-avoided questioning into how it can help us achieve a carbon-neutral power system (News, January 4th). The refusal to consider, or even mention, nuclear has been evident in Ireland’s governments for many years. In the meantime (since Citizens’ Assembly 2016 where nuclear was not discussed) a voluntary group of professionals has published (as booklet and online) the environmental and economic case for a small proportion of modern nuclear energy on the grid. Mark Foley’s mention of this, Nuclear Energy Development in Ireland – Preliminary Study, would be a good way for those interested to learn more about small modular reactors and their suitability for Ireland. – Yours, etc, ANNE BAILY, Carrick-on-Suir, Co Tipperary.
