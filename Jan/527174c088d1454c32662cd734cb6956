Sam Bennett conceded his race leader’s jersey on the fourth stage of the Vuelta a San Juan in Argentina late on Wednesday, with the Carrick on Suir rider losing time on the day’s first category climb of the Gruta Virgen de Andacollo. The stage was the hardest thus far of the race and also led to a lot of confusion, with TV commentators and the race organiser’s social media incorrectly stating that Bennett was in the day’s breakaway. Instead, fellow Irishman Ryan Mullen was amongst the day’s aggressors. There was a partial regrouping in the flatter second half to the stage, with Fernando Gaviria (Movistar) sprinting home first of a 50 rider front group. He finished ahead of the former world champion Peter Sagan (TotalEnergies) and Filippo Ganna (Ineos Grenadiers). Mullen was in this bunch and crashed inside the final 300 metres, suffering injuries which fortunately were not too serious. Bennett finished in another big group over 11 minutes back, keeping his powder dry for two upcoming opportunities. Thursday is a rest day on the race, with the hardest stage to follow on Friday. However the two remaining days on Saturday and Sunday are flat and very likely to finish with bunch sprints. [ Sam Bennett interview: ‘I’ve won the Green Jersey already, so why can’t I do it again?’ ] This gives Bennett two further chances to add to his victory on stage one. Notwithstanding his time loss on Wednesday’s stage, he has shown fine form in the race. His stage one win was followed by fourth on stage two and third on stage three, and have given him a substantial morale boost in what is his first competitive outing of 2023.
