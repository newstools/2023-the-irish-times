Sir, – In November at the UN Cop27 climate summit, Micheál Martin delivered what appeared to be a heartfelt speech. He spoke about his aspirations for a sustainable planet with an abundance of plant and animal life, cleaner air and water. He finished by saying, “This generation of leaders cannot say they didn’t know.” Perhaps he didn’t share this vision with other members of his party, including the Minister for Agriculture, who was delighted to announce a new trade deal for Irish beef to China, following what he described as “huge efforts” (News, January 5th). A deal to supply beef to a country of 1.426 billion people means more cattle, more emissions, more biodiversity loss, more animal suffering. No mention of course of the Paris agreement and the pledge to cut agricultural emissions by 25 per cent. The environmental impact of beef is enormous. China is an affluent country, as is Ireland. This is a financial deal but at what cost? Our food production system is harming the planet and contributing to global food poverty. Micheál Martin is correct about one thing: he cannot say “we didn’t know”. – Yours, etc, JOAN BURGESS, Cork.
