What is it? Sage and onion stuffed Irish pork fillet (€9.99, 815g, serves four). What’s good about it? It is part of the new Cook at Home range at Dunnes Stores, a collection of 17 Irish beef, pork, lamb, chicken and bacon ready-to-cook dishes designed to be time-saving options for busy people. The stuffing is generous and flavourful, and the meat is wrapped in maple glazed streaky bacon. It will easily serve four, with vegetable side dishes. How do I use it? This is the interesting part: you bake it in the bag it comes in, gently at first and then with a blast of heat towards the end of the 50-minute cooking time, keeping the pork juicy while the bacon crisps up. I cooked it in an air fryer, and it was done in 35 minutes. Where can I buy it? It’s on sale in 54 branches of Dunnes Stores, and online too from dunnesstoresgrocery.com. Anything else? Other standouts include a very tasty rosemary, sea salt and black pepper Irish lamb chump with herb butter (serves two, €11.99) and tomato and basil Irish meatballs (serves two, €6.99). The meatballs, made with a mixture of beef and pork, come in a tomato and basil sauce and are topped with cheddar cheese. This product was a bronze award winner at the Blas na hÉireann awards this year. There are a further six products in the range coming to stores next month.
