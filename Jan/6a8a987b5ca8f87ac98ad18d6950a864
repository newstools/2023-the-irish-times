A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was found dead at an apartment in Ashtown, Dublin, on Friday with suspected stab wounds. Gardaí are investigating “all circumstances” surrounding the discovery of the victim, who was in her 40s. Gardaí and emergency services were alerted to the incident at Royal Canal Park, Ashtown, Dublin 15, at about 10am. “The female was found unresponsive in an apartment and was pronounced dead at the scene a short time later,” a Garda spokesman said. It is understood a man who had earlier been acting erratically at a bus stop was detained under mental health legislation, leading to the discovery of the woman’s body. The man in detention was known to the victim and it is understood he was to receive medical treatment before being interviewed by detectives. Gardaí said they are not looking for anyone else in relation to the investigation. The man was later arrested on suspicion of murder and is currently detained in Finglas Garda station under Section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1984. The woman’s body has been removed from the apartment to the City Morgue in Whitehall, where a postmortem examination will be conducted by State Pathologist Dr Linda Mulligan on Saturday. The scene was preserved to allow for a forensic and technical examination by the Garda Technical Bureau. A Garda spokesman said detectives are appealing for anyone with information or any witnesses who could help the investigation to come forward. Anyone with information is asked to contact Finglas Garda station on 01-6667500, or the Garda Confidential Line on 1800-666111.
