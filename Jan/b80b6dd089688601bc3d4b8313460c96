It was a big night for Martin McDonagh’s Banshees of Inisherin at last night’s Golden Globe awards, in Los Angeles. The Irish movie won three prizes: best comedy or musical film, best actor in a musical or comedy, for Colin Farrell, and best screenplay, for McDonagh. Farrell wore a traditional black tuxedo, his costar Barry Keoghan a custom Louis Vuitton suit. Here’s what some of this year’s other attendees wore on the red carpet.
