Sir, – Niamh Byrne and Yvonne Harnett (Letters, January 7th) are no doubt on to something important when they highlight that for some people driving is not only the best option but in some cases the only realistic option for getting around our cities. But because of the physical dimension of cars, and the need for substantial breaking distances between vehicles, they use substantially more road space than other forms of transport. Around 1,000 people can travel along a car lane per hour, whereas around 5,000 people can cycle along a bike lane and a similar number can move along a bus lane. If we can encourage more people who aren’t so reliant on the private car to switch to walking, cycling, or to public transport, we can free up space for those who must drive. Bringing in more cycle lanes and bus lanes might feel like an attack on people who depend upon the car, but it will, in fact, make better use of our road space and so make it easier for those reliant on the car to get around. Likewise on-street car parking is a poor use of valuable road space. Off-street multi-storey car parking can store more cars using less space. Finally, not everyone going to a hospital needs to drive. Not all staff need to drive, and many patients are happy to use public transport where it’s reliable and fast. – Yours, etc, ANDREW MONTAGUE, Ballymun, Dublin 9.
