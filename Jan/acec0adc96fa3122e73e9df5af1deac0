Sir, – As a vulnerable road user (motorcyclist), I would like to highlight the following for drivers of four (or more) wheeled vehicles. 1) Stop means stop. Stop at or before the line, only then observe, before moving off. Don’t proceed just because the car in front of you moved off. 2) Put the mobile phone away. 3) Do not cross the continuous white line, especially not on a right-hand bend. You will eventually strike a road user coming in the opposite direction and, if it’s a cyclist or motorcyclist, you will seriously injure or kill them. 4) Use your mirrors and look over your shoulder before changing position on the road, turning or overtaking. That motorbike didn’t come out of nowhere – you weren’t observing. Indicate before you move, not as or after you change position. – Yours, etc, PAUL STACK, Maynooth, Co Kildare.
