Sir, – Melanie McDonagh’s proposal that the festive season should be extended through January will strike fear into the souls of many (“It’s time for a return to the forgotten tradition of ‘Long Christmas’”, Rite & Reason, January 10th). Nollaig na mBan is well observed in my corner of Dublin and the women I met socially last Friday were relieved to see the back of Christmas. Keeping the lights up is easy. Mine are always up at least until the coming of Brigid the Light-bearer (or Candlemas, as still celebrated in my local C of I church). But for every feaster and merry-maker there’s a cook and a cleaner and in many Irish households that’s still one woman. The reason well-off Victorians could feast and make merry through January is this: they had staff. – Yours, etc, VICTORIA WHITE, Clonskeagh, Dublin 14.
