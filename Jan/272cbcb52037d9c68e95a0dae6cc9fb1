Two modern classics from SuperValu this week, both wines that we buy regularly but would have been unknown to our parents. Rías Baixas is in Galicia, in northwest Spain, close to Santiago de Compostella, which will be familiar to many Irish pilgrims who have walked the camino. Coonawarra is a small cigar-shaped region in South Australia, just 2km wide by 15km long. The unique red terra-rossa soils are responsible for some of the greatest Aussie cabernets. I have featured this wine before, but it’s exceptional value after this discount. Fresh and lightly aromatic, with mouth-watering plump pear fruits, this makes a great sipping wine but would be even better with Thai prawns or chicken. The Coonawarra region has a reputation for producing some of the most distinctive cabernets in Australia, with a combination of lead pencil, eucalyptus and ripe dark fruits. This is a classic example: rich, powerful and ripe with cassis, mint, dark chocolate overlaid with toasty new oak. Try it with a grilled steak to bring back memories of the barbie last summer.
