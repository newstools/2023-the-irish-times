Sir, – Judging by your recent headline “Bus lanes in Ranelagh and car parking at Merrion Square to be reallocated to cyclists” (News, January 5th), it would be easy to imagine, as recent letter-writers have (January 7th), that all public transport in Ranelagh village is being drastically compromised by the quick-build plan to join up the existing short and discontinuous sections of protected cycle lanes along this route. In fact, only two short sections of “bus” lane will be affected by the plan, neither of which is in the parking-congested Ranelagh village. It’s also worth mentioning that neither of these sections is restricted to buses at the moment. On Charlemont Street, the bus lanes are shared with taxis and (unprotected) people cycling, while northbound on Ranelagh Road after Mountpleasant Park, the bus lane also accommodates part-time parking. In the latter case, both buses and people on bikes, including children who attend the nearby school, regularly have to go out into the main carriageway to avoid the parked cars. – Yours, etc, MIA GALLAGHER, Inchicore, Dublin 8.
