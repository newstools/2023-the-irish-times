1. Crack the eggs into a bowl and weigh them. They should be about 50g-70g each, so about 200g in total. 2. Add 400ml warm water and a pinch of salt. Whisk to combine. 3. Pour the egg mix through a sieve into four ovenproof ramekins or bowls. This removes any unwanted bubbles. 4. Cover each bowl with pierced cling film or loose tin foil. This is to prevent water from dripping on the surface of the eggs, yet will allow steam to escape. 5. Place a few inches of water in a pan, and once it begins to boil place the oven-safe ramekins in it. I usually place jam jar lids underneath to prevent them from cracking. Steam for 10-12 minutes. This can also be done in a steamer basket or bamboo steamer. 6. Once cooked, cut through the curd and drizzle with the soy sauce and sesame oil. Arrange the spring onion and sesame seeds on top and serve right away. Steamed rice makes a great side dish to this.
