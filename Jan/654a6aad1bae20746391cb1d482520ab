1. Make the hot honey first. This can be done just before you roast the vegetables or a few days beforehand. Pour the honey into a small pan. Add the chillies, vinegar, rosemary, garlic and a pinch of salt. Simmer very low for five minutes, then pour into a jar and set aside. The longer it’s left, the spicier it’ll get. 2. Preheat the oven to 220 degrees. Chop the peeled veg into similar sized cubes so they all cook evenly. Drizzle with olive oil, salt and black pepper, then mix well. 3. Roast for 20 minutes or until the veg are done to your liking. 4. Meanwhile mix the yoghurt with the herbs, tahini and lemon juice. Season with salt to taste. Set aside. 5. Once the veg is cooked, spread the yoghurt on to a platter or serving bowl. Arrange the veg on top and drizzle it all with the hot honey.
