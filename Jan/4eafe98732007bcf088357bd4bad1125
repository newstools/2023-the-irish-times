The agency’s report also noted there were 161 early-stage company approvals or start-ups with funding in 2022. “I am delighted to announce that 2022 was a strong year with our client companies creating 19,660 new jobs, growing net employment by 5 per cent,” Enterprise Ireland chief executive Leo Clancy said. “This compares favorably with the latest CSO (Central Statistics Office) Labour Force Survey for 2022 which showed an increase of 3.4 per cent in total employment across the economy,” he said. “Of note is the significant growth in key sectors of the economy ranging from Life sciences, Prepared Consumer Food to Technology and Services,” Mr Clancy said. “Supporting Irish-owned companies to achieve greater scale and expand their global footprint is a priority for Enterprise Ireland in 2023 and we are committed to supporting Irish companies on their journey to become global leaders in their field,” he said. “This will ensure that Irish enterprise continues to create and sustain jobs, providing a platform for strong economic growth into the future,” Mr Clancy said.
